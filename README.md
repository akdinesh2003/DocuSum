![DocuSum Screenshot](https://placehold.co/800x450)

**DocuSum** is a sleek and modern web application built with Next.js that leverages the power of generative AI to provide intelligent summaries of any text content. Paste in your document, article, or notes, and let the AI provide a clear, concise analysis.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Dual Summary Modes**: Choose between a "Quick Summary" for bullet-point highlights or a "Deep Analysis" for a detailed, paragraph-style summary complete with sentiment and tone analysis.
-   **AI Quality Score**: Every summary is automatically evaluated by another AI model to provide a quality score, giving you confidence in the result.
-   **Sentiment & Tone Analysis**: The "Deep Analysis" mode reveals the emotional sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) and the writing tone (e.g., formal, optimistic) of the original text.
-   **Export Your Summaries**: Easily export the generated summary and its analysis as a Markdown (`.md`) or a plain text (`.txt`) file.
-   **Responsive Design**: A clean, dark-mode interface that looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.
-   **Built with a Modern Tech Stack**: Powered by Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, ShadCN UI, and Google's Genkit for AI functionality.
